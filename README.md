# VIDEO2SCART
<p>this project is about a PCB that connects the Commodore C128 video outputs (RGBi & composite / S-Video) to a SCART display device!
I created this project online on www.easyEDA.com and ordered the PCBs from www.JLCPCB.com and the parts from www.LCSC.com</p> 

<h3>directories INFO:</h3>
<p><strong>PCB</strong> --> one PDF for assembling, one PDF of the PCB view, the GERBER Files for ordering the PCB from a PCB manufactorer.</p>
<p><strong>3DPrint</strong> --> the STL files of the housing ... ready for 3D printing</p>
<p>the schematic PDF shows the circuite of all components.</p>
<p>Please read the cable assembling INFO PDFs ... coming soon.</p>
<p>cheers ... <strong>JDet</strong></p>
