# VIDEO2SCART
this project is about a PCB that connects the Commodore C128 video outputs (RGBi & composite / S-Video) to a SCART display device!
I created this project online on www.easyeda.com and ordered the PCBs from www.JLCPCB.com and the parts from www.LCSC.com 

directories INFO:
PCB --> one PDF for assembling, one PDF of the PCB view, the GERBER Files for ordering the PCB from a PCB manufactorer.
3DPrint --> the STL files of the housing ... ready for 3D printing
the schematic PDF shows the circuite of all components.

Please read the cable assembling INFO PDFs ... coming soon.

greets ... JDet
